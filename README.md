# Description
Blackjack is a player vs dealer card game.  The objective of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding 21.  Each player and the dealer will be dealt two cards in the beginning.  The players cards will be revealed while one of the dealer's cards will be hidden.  An "Ace" can be a 1 or 11, "Face cards" (King, Queen, Jack) equals 10.  "Hit" means to ask for another card while "Stay" is to keep the cards the player currently has.  The dealer will "hit" until their cards total 17 or higher and if the dealer goes over 21(also called "Bust") then everyone wins.  If a player goes over 21(also called "Bust") then the dealer will win regardless of the dealer's hand.  If player and dealer have the same total then it results in a "Push" or "Draw".  If either side is dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10 or Ace & face card) then it results in an automatic win which is also referred to as "Blackjack".
